# go-http-server

Made with inspiration from [codecrafters](https://codecrafters.io/) and the [go standard http library](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http).

This go app is an HTTP server created from scratch(ish?) by creating a TCP server and responding using the HTTP/1.1 protocol, it also aims to include all the basic features an HTTP server has.

## This HTTP server contains

- [x] Handling of different paths
- [x] Path parameters
- [x] Response body
- [x] Path parameters
- [x] Query parameters
- [ ] Read POST requests
- [ ] Timeout requests
- [ ] Caching
- [ ] Rate limiting
